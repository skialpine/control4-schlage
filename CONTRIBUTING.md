# Contributing to control4-schlage

Project build and authentication test instructions are in
[docs/development.md](docs/development.md). This project builds the OSS
distribution and declares no build-time service credentials.

## Project Structure

This project uses [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/) to manage shared
infrastructure across multiple Control4 driver repositories. Shared code lives
in a [template repo](https://github.com/finitelabs/control4-driver-template) and
is synced into each driver project. This project uses the original Finite Labs
repository, pinned in `.copier-answers.yml`; it does not use a project-owned
template fork.

### What's Managed by the Template

These files are owned by the template and **should not be edited directly** in
this repo. Change them in the
[template repo](https://github.com/finitelabs/control4-driver-template) instead,
then pull the change in with `copier update`.

**Build tooling:**

- `Makefile`: build, format, docs, package, and clean targets
- `.github/workflows/build.yml`: CI build and packaging
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: tagged GitHub releases. The updater offers a
  release only when its tag's date is later than the installed driver's version,
  so give each release a later date than the last. A suffixed tag such as
  `v20260918-rc1` publishes as a pre-release, which only drivers on the
  Prerelease update channel pick up. Title the pull request that dates the
  changelog `release: vYYYYMMDD` (case and the colon don't matter):
  `.github/workflows/label-release-pr.yml` then labels it `skip-release-notes`,
  which `.github/release.yml` leaves out of the generated release notes. It
  labels a template update the same way: a title like
  `chore: copier update to template vX.Y.Z`, or any pull request opened with a
  change to `_commit` in `.copier-answers.yml`. So keep a template update in a
  pull request of its own, or the changes riding along with it drop out of the
  notes too; if one does ride along, remove the label and it stays off. Adding
  that label by hand leaves any other pull request out of the notes too

**Common libraries (`src/lib/`):**

- `bindings.lua`: binding management
- `conditionals.lua`: conditional/programming UI management
- `driver-filenames.lua`: every `.c4z` the repo builds, written in by the build
- `drivercentral.lua`: the DriverCentral product, its cloud client and the
  license gate (see [The License Gate](#the-license-gate))
- `events.lua`: event firing and management
- `http.lua`: HTTP client wrapper
- `logging.lua`: structured logging with configurable levels
- `lru.lua`: LRU cache utility
- `persist.lua`: persistent storage abstraction
- `redact.lua`: masks credentials in log lines and diagnostics reports
- `support-code.lua`: the Support Code that opens a DriverCentral build's Lua
  window (see [The Support Code](#the-support-code))
- `update-settings.lua`: keeps Automatic Updates and Update Channel the same on
  every item of the drivers the repo builds, in DriverCentral and OSS builds
- `utils.lua`: general utilities (XML, device queries, table helpers, type
  coercion)
- `values.lua`: value parsing, coercion, and formatting
- `github-updater.lua`: GitHub Releases self-updater (OSS builds)

**Vendor libraries (`vendor/`):**

- `JSON.lua`: JSON encoder/decoder
- `deferred.lua`: promises/deferred implementation
- `drivers-common-public/`: Control4's official shared libraries
- `xml/`: XML parser (xml2lua)
- `cloud-client-byte.lua`: DriverCentral cloud licensing
- `version.lua`: semver comparison (used by github-updater)
- `bitn.lua`: bit manipulation library
- `crypto.lua`: cryptographic primitives (core build; requires `bitn`)

**Tools (`tools/`):**

- `preprocess.py`: C-style `#ifdef`/`#ifndef` preprocessor for Lua, XML, and
  Markdown
- `docs.py`: documentation generation (Markdown -> HTML -> PDF, plus README) and
  the Markdown formatting `make fmt` runs
- `package.py`: packaging helpers (driver.xml stamping, zip bundling)
- `deps.py`: build preflight, checks the `.venv` against `requirements.txt`
- `gen-squishy.lua`: auto-generates squishy files from driver.c4zproj
- `github-markdown.css`: vendored stylesheet for the rendered docs
- `github-setup`: checks the GitHub repo against the standard settings and
  prints the drift; `--apply` fixes it
- `test_preprocess.py`: tests for `preprocess.py`'s `#embed` and
  `#driver-filenames` directives

**Other:**

- `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `requirements.txt`, the build-time Python dependency list
- `test/testlib.lua`, `test/c4_fixtures.lua`, `test/c4_shim.lua`,
  `test/run_test.sh`, and the `test/test_*.lua` suites covering shared code
- `.copier-answers.yml`, which Copier maintains; never edit it by hand

### What's Driver-Specific (Yours to Edit)

- `src/constants.lua`: driver-specific constants
- `drivers/*/driver.lua`: main driver logic
- `drivers/*/driver.xml`: driver XML configuration
- `drivers/*/driver.c4zproj`: driver packaging manifest
- `drivers/*/www/`: documentation and icons
- `CHANGELOG.md`, seeded by the template on first render and left alone after
  that
- Any additional `src/` modules specific to this driver
- Any additional `vendor/` libraries specific to this driver
- `test/` suites written for this driver, and the local support files they
  require (`test/c4_local.lua`, `test/<prefix>_fixtures.lua`)

`README.md` is in neither list: it is **generated**. `make build` rewrites it
from the driver's `www/documentation/index.md`, so edit the source doc, not the
README.

Driver docs can use GitHub's alerts: a quote whose first line is `[!NOTE]`,
`[!TIP]`, `[!IMPORTANT]`, `[!WARNING]` or `[!CAUTION]`. The README, the HTML doc
and the PDF all show them as GitHub does. The marker goes alone on its line, and
the quote must not sit inside a list or another quote; otherwise it stays a
plain quote that shows the marker.

Images that every driver's docs share, the Finite Labs logo
(`finite-labs-logo.png`) and `check-drivers.png` (the DriverCentral Cloud
driver's Check Drivers action), ship with the template in
`resources/documentation/images/`. A doc that links `./images/<name>` and has no
copy of its own gets the template's at build time, so a driver's `images/` holds
only its own.

## Updating Shared Code

Copier is only needed for this occasional sync. It is **not** a build dependency
and is intentionally not installed by `make init`, so run it without installing
anything:

```bash
uvx copier update --trust        # using uv (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
# or:
pipx run copier update --trust   # using pipx
```

Copier shows diffs for any files that changed and lets you resolve conflicts. It
tracks which template version you're on via the `.copier-answers.yml` file
(committed to the repo). To update every driver repo, run the same command in
each one.

## Build System

This project uses `make` for build orchestration. All tooling is Python (in a
local `.venv`) plus a few standalone binaries, with no Node/npm. A repo that
adds Node tooling of its own pins the version in `.node-version`, which nodenv
reads locally and the Build workflow sets up in CI.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ (docs, formatters, preprocess, and driverpackager)
- Git, since `make init` clones the driverpackager into `dist/`
- [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org/) (`brew install luajit`) to run
  `tools/gen-squishy.lua` and the tests
- [stylua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua) (`brew install stylua`), the
  Lua formatter
- [Pango](https://gtk.org/) (`brew install pango`), WeasyPrint's PDF rendering
  engine
- `swig` and OpenSSL headers (`brew install swig openssl`), which M2Crypto
  compiles against

`make init` creates the `.venv`, installs everything in `requirements.txt`
(WeasyPrint, markdown-it-py, mdit-py-plugins, Pygments, mdformat, black, and the
driverpackager's M2Crypto + lxml), and clones the driverpackager into
`dist/driverpackager`. It is safe (and cheap) to re-run: the install is keyed on
`requirements.txt`, so a template update that adds a dependency reinstalls on
the next `make init` or `make build` rather than leaving the existing `.venv`
stale.

### Common Commands

```bash
make help          # List every pipeline step, plus init/build/fmt/clean
make init          # Install all dependencies (safe to re-run)
make check-deps    # Install if needed, then verify .venv matches requirements.txt
make build         # Full build, from clean through zip (see Build Pipeline)
make build-nodocs  # Build without generating docs
make verify        # After a build, check what CI checks after one
make test          # Run the Lua test suite (test/test_*.lua) and tools/test_*.py
make support-code  # Print today's Support Code (see The Support Code)
make fmt           # Format all code (Lua, Python, Markdown)
make check         # Assert formatting and build secrets without rewriting, as CI does
make clean         # Remove build artifacts and dist/ (including driverpackager)
make clean-all     # Remove everything (build artifacts, dist, deps, venv)
```

Every step in the pipeline below is also a target of its own, and `make help`
lists them all. The sub-targets those steps delegate to (`fmt-lua`, `fmt-py`,
`fmt-md`, `docs-html`, `docs-pdf`, `docs-readme`, `update-xml-version`,
`update-xml-modified`) are real targets too, but carry no `##` annotation, so
`make help` does not print them. Note that the later steps read `build/`:
`make docs` pulls in `preprocess` itself, but `make package` and `make zip` fail
on a clean tree until something has populated `build/`.

### Build Pipeline

`make build` runs these in order, starting from a cleaned `build/`:

1. **Format**: stylua (Lua), black (Python), mdformat (Markdown)
1. **Preprocess**: resolve `#ifdef`/`#ifndef` directives per distribution
1. **Generate squishy**: create squish manifests from .c4zproj files
1. **Update driver.xml**: stamp version date and modified timestamp
1. **Generate docs**: Markdown -> HTML -> PDF, plus README
1. **Package**: run driverpackager to create .c4z files
1. **Zip**: bundle the c4z and docs folders per distribution

The driver.xml step stamps today's date as the version unless `DRIVER_VERSION`
is set. On a tag build CI sets it to the tag's date, so the tag must be
`vYYYYMMDD` or `vYYYYMMDD-suffix` or the build fails.

A repo with no driver yet (no `drivers/*/driver.xml`) builds and verifies
nothing, and CI uploads nothing, so a new repo's first pull request goes green.

Each distribution's outputs are grouped by type under `dist/<distribution>/`:
`c4z/` (packaged drivers), `docs/` (generated PDFs) and `source/` (the squished
per-driver Lua). `<repo>.zip` sits alongside them and contains `c4z/` and
`docs/` only: `source/` is the driver's unencrypted Lua, which an encrypted
driver must not ship.

Step 1 rewrites tracked files in place. Formatting covers `tools/*.py`, all Lua
under `drivers/`, `src/`, `test/`, `tools/` and `vendor/`, and every Markdown
file at the repo root, under `documentation/`, and under
`drivers/*/www/documentation/`, so it reformats this file, the driver docs you
author, and the generated `README.md` too. CI fails the build if it finishes
with a dirty tree, so build on a clean checkout and commit whatever the
formatter changes.

After the build CI runs `make verify`, which runs the same locally: every
distribution made a PDF (`verify-pdfs`), every `.c4z` is at `DRIVER_VERSION`
when one is given (`verify-version`; CI gives the tag's date on a tag build),
and the tree is clean (`verify-clean`).

### Distributions

The shared template supports two distributions: `drivercentral`, which defines
`DRIVERCENTRAL`, and `oss`, which defines `OSS`. This project selects only `oss`
through `Makefile.local`. The optional DriverCentral facilities described below
are shared-template reference material and are not enabled for this driver.

The DriverCentral build reports to DriverCentral as the product named by the
`dc_pid` answer in `.copier-answers.yml`. It is 0 until the product exists in
DriverCentral's vendor panel. Setting it and running `copier update` is all a
repo needs before its first DriverCentral upload.

Every DriverCentral build is packaged encrypted, `encryption="2"` on each
driver's `<script>`, and `make package` deletes its plain-text
`dist/<build>/source`: a sold driver's Lua, its license check included, never
ships or uploads readable. Only `driver.lua` is encrypted, so any other file a
driver loads from its `.c4z` stays readable. An `oss` build is encrypted only
when it substitutes a build secret.

## Writing Tests

A test is a plain Lua script in `test/`, named `test_*.lua`, run by `make test`
or `./test/run_test.sh test_something.lua`. There is one convention, and every
suite in this repo follows it.

```lua
local T = require("testlib")

T.section("What is under test")
T.eq("the name of the case", got, want)

T.finish()
```

Three shared modules, split by what they depend on:

- **`testlib.lua`** is the harness: assertions, grouping, and the pass/fail
  pipeline. Plain Lua, no Control4 in it. Always required.
- **`c4_shim.lua`** mocks the Control4 `C4:*` environment. `make test` and
  `run_test.sh` preload it, so a suite that drives driver code gets it for free.
- **`c4_fixtures.lua`** holds the reusable C4 seams built on the shim. Require
  it only when you need one.

### Assertions

Assertions accumulate rather than throw, so one run reports every failure
instead of stopping at the first. Each takes the case name first.

| Call                                     | Passes when                                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `T.check(name, ok, detail)`              | `ok` is truthy; the base the others build on          |
| `T.eq(name, got, want)`                  | `got` equals `want`, comparing tables by value        |
| `T.neq(name, got, unwanted)`             | `got` differs from `unwanted`                         |
| `T.truthy(name, v)` / `T.falsy(name, v)` | `v` is / is not truthy                                |
| `T.contains(name, haystack, needle)`     | `needle` occurs in `haystack`                         |
| `T.excludes(name, haystack, needle)`     | `needle` does not occur                               |
| `T.raises(name, fn, expected)`           | `fn` throws, and the message holds `expected`         |
| `T.raisesAt(name, fn)`                   | `fn` throws with the error blamed on the calling file |

`T.excludes` is the one to reach for when the point is that a secret never
reaches the output, because it reports the offending text on failure.

Supporting calls: `T.section(name)` starts a numbered group, `T.capture(fn)`
runs `fn` with `print` collected and returns `ok, err, output`, and
`T.unload(pattern, ...)` drops matching `package.loaded` entries so the next
`require` rebuilds whatever the module caches.

### Ending a test

`T.finish()` prints the summary and sets the exit code. Do not keep your own
`pass`/`fail` counters, print your own summary, or call `os.exit` yourself.

### C4 fixtures

`c4_fixtures.lua` carries the seams that need the shim:

- `F.withShim(opts, body)` reloads the shim with luasocket forced present or
  absent and restores every global afterwards. With `{ luasocket = true }`,
  `body` gets a clock whose `advance(seconds)` moves time forward and fires
  whatever came due. Returns `ok, err`.
- `F.captureTcpClient()` swaps in a `C4:CreateTCPClient` that records every
  write and completes the connect synchronously. Read `.writes`, then
  `.restore()`.

### Persisted values

As on a controller, a `C4:PersistSetValue` reads back only once it lands, about
50 ms after the call, and until then `C4:PersistGetValue` answers what the store
held. A delete reads back at once, and a write still waiting lands after it. A
value written encrypted reads back only with the encrypted flag, so a suite that
seeds or reads such a key passes the flag the driver does.

The shim lands a write when it moves time on: `ShimFireTimers` lands every write
made before it, `C4:ProcessTimers` each one 50 ms old by its clock, and
`ShimUpdateDriver` and `ShimRestartDirector` all of them. A suite that calls
into the driver itself calls `ShimPersistLand()` where one call ends and the
next begins, such as before a reload, and before it reads what was stored. A
suite that needs a write read back at once calls `ShimPersistLater(false)`.

### Driver-local test support

Support code specific to this driver stays in this repo. Two files mirror the
shared pair above, split by what the code is *about*:

- **`test/c4_local.lua`** for environment seams: a `C4:*` method, or a bare
  global the driver code calls, that the shim does not provide. Reach for this
  instead of adding to `c4_shim.lua`, which the template owns, so anything local
  in there becomes merge surface on every `copier update`.
- **`test/<prefix>_fixtures.lua`** for domain fixtures: mocks shaped like this
  driver's own protocol or API, parallel to `c4_fixtures.lua`. Use a short
  prefix taken from the driver name.

Both `require("c4_shim")` and build on the C4 environment rather than replacing
it. Neither runner needs telling about them: `make test` collects only
`test_*.lua`, and both put `test/` on `LUA_PATH`, so `require("c4_local")`
resolves on its own.

Promote either one into the template only once a second driver needs it.

### Tools tests

`make test` also runs each `tools/test_*.py` with `python3`. These test the
Python tools in `tools/` with the standard library's `unittest` and need no
`.venv`.

## Preprocessor Directives

The `tools/preprocess.py` script supports C-style conditional compilation. It
walks every file in the build tree and matches four comment styles: Lua (`--#`),
XML and Markdown (`<!-- # -->`), C and JavaScript (`// #`), and bare `#`
directives with no comment prefix.

```lua
--#ifdef DRIVERCENTRAL
local supportCode = require("lib.support-code")
--#else
DRIVER_GITHUB_REPO = "skialpine/control4-schlage"
--#endif
```

```xml
<!-- #ifdef DRIVERCENTRAL -->
<Driver type="c4z" name="driver_dc" squishLua="true">
<!-- #else -->
<Driver type="c4z" name="driver" squishLua="true">
<!-- #endif -->
```

It also resolves `<!-- #embed-changelog -->`, which splices `CHANGELOG.md` into
the generated documentation, and `<!-- #embed <path> -->`, which splices the
file at `<path>`, relative to the file holding the directive. Both run as a
pre-pass, so directives inside the spliced text are still honored. A missing
`<path>`, or an `#embed` inside an embedded file, fails the build.

### Variant Expansion

Drivers can define variants via a `variants.json` file. The preprocessor expands
these into multiple driver directories with substituted values, generating one
.c4z per variant combination. Variants can be listed flat or given as
`dimensions`, in which case the cross-product is expanded.

Substitute a variant value with `__NAME__`, or with `%%NAME%%` in Markdown,
where `__NAME__` would render as bold instead.

In any Lua file, `-- #driver-filenames` emits one `"<name>.c4z",` line per
driver the build packages, variants included, `<name>` being the `<Driver name>`
its `driver.c4zproj` gives in that build, so a list of the repo's drivers never
goes stale. `lib/driver-filenames.lua` holds the repo's list that way, for the
GitHub updater and `lib/update-settings.lua`.

`readme_driver_slug` may name a generated variant, e.g. `<driver>_<suffix>`.
`make build` takes the README and its images from the build output, where only
the generated variants exist.

### Build Secrets

Values that must not live in the repository, such as a cloud API's OAuth client
secret, are substituted into the build tree at preprocess time. Each one is a
`__NAME__` placeholder in source (`%%NAME%%` in Markdown), the same syntax as a
variant value:

```lua
API_CLIENT_SECRET = "__EXAMPLE_CLIENT_SECRET__"
```

`.env.default`, committed at the repository root, declares every name, one
`NAME=` line each, with a comment saying what it is and where to get it. A repo
without it has no build secrets. `tools/preprocess.py` reads only the declared
names, and takes each value from, in order:

1. the process environment
1. `.env`, gitignored: for a local build, `cp .env.default .env` and fill it in
1. on macOS, the login Keychain: a generic password with the service
   `control4-driver-build` and the name as its account, so no file holds it

To put one in the Keychain (`-w` last, with no value, prompts for it and keeps
it out of shell history):

```bash
security add-generic-password -s control4-driver-build -a NAME -w
```

In CI, the Build workflow passes `make build` each build secret by name from the
repository's GitHub Actions secrets (add each name under Settings > Secrets and
variables > Actions), so `make build` and the tools it runs never see any other
secret. The template passes its own: `SUPPORT_CODE_SECRET` with a DriverCentral
build, and the four `INFLUXDB_*` with Cloud Monitoring. A driver's own go in the
copier answer `extra_build_secrets`
(`uvx copier update --trust --data extra_build_secrets="NAME OTHER"`), and
`make check` fails when `.env.default` and the workflow disagree. Each value is
a single line.

A name with no value builds as an empty string with a warning, so a pull request
from a fork, which gets no secrets, still builds. A tag build sets
`REQUIRE_SECRETS`, and a missing value fails it, so a release never ships
without them. The build log says only whether each name was set.

When a build substitutes any placeholder, every driver in it is packaged
encrypted (`encryption="2"` on its `<script>`, set in the build copy of
`driver.xml`), and `make package` deletes the plain-text squished Lua in
`dist/<build>/source`, so neither the `.c4z` nor a CI artifact carries the value
in the clear. Only `build/` keeps it, and that is gitignored and never uploaded.
Keep placeholders out of documentation: a PDF is not encrypted.

A DriverCentral build is packaged encrypted with or without a secret.
`make package` then opens every package of an encrypted build and fails unless
each holds `driver.lua.encrypted`, no `driver.lua`, and a `driver.xml` that asks
for encryption.

### The License Gate

`lib/drivercentral.lua` is a DriverCentral build's link to DriverCentral: the
product it sells as, the cloud client that licenses it, and the gate that stops
the driver while it has no license. The client keeps the license in `DC_X`: 1
when licensed (a showroom license too), minus the hours left in a trial, and 0
without one. It is 0 from the driver's late init until the DriverCentral Cloud
driver first answers, and it turns 0 when the Cloud driver stops answering for a
minute.

The gate reads `DC_X` every 10 s and stops the driver after five minutes of 0,
longer than a Cloud driver update or a slow boot, and starts it again as soon as
a license is back. With `dc_pid` 0 the client never starts and the gate stops
the driver at its load, so a build made before its product exists does not run.

Each driver of a DriverCentral build starts the client first in `OnDriverInit`
and the gate at the end of `OnDriverLateInit`:

```lua
--#ifdef DRIVERCENTRAL
local drivercentral = require("lib.drivercentral")
--#endif

function OnDriverInit()
  --#ifdef DRIVERCENTRAL
  drivercentral:startClient()
  --#else
  C4:AllowExecute(true)
  --#endif
end

function OnDriverLateInit()
  --#ifdef DRIVERCENTRAL
  drivercentral:startGate(function(licensed)
    -- Stop or start the connection, and show why in Driver Status.
  end)
  --#endif
end
```

A driver that talks to a device or a cloud checks `drivercentral:licensed()` at
the one place every command passes on its way out, and shows
`drivercentral.UNLICENSED_STATUS` in Driver Status while it is stopped. An OSS
build has no gate, so those calls sit inside `#ifdef DRIVERCENTRAL` too. A
companion that reaches its device only through another driver needs no gate of
its own. Never gate `ExecuteCommand` ahead of the client: the license arrives
through it.

`test/dc_cloud.lua` is a fake Cloud driver that answers the real client, for
testing a driver's gate; `test/test_drivercentral.lua` shows how.

### The Support Code

A DriverCentral build calls `C4:AllowExecute(false)`, which closes Composer's
Lua window to anything typed into it. The Support Code opens it again for an
hour, for support on a system the build runs on. The code changes every UTC day,
and `make support-code` prints the day's code. Entering it again closes the
window early, and so does reloading the driver; a code from yesterday is taken
until 01:00 UTC.

The code is an HMAC of the date under the build secret `SUPPORT_CODE_SECRET`,
which `lib/support-code.lua` takes inside an `#ifdef DRIVERCENTRAL`, so an OSS
build never carries it. Declare it in `.env.default`, give it to CI as an
Actions secret, and keep it in the Keychain for local builds and
`make support-code`. Make it with `openssl rand -hex 32`: it goes into a Lua
string as it is. A secret shorter than 32 characters, or none, turns the code
off: such a build takes no code at all. A tag build fails without it, as for any
build secret.

Each driver of a DriverCentral build takes the code through a property at the
end of its Driver Settings:

```xml
<!-- #ifdef DRIVERCENTRAL -->
<property>
  <name>Support Code</name>
  <type>STRING</type>
  <default/>
  <description>Enter only a code from Finite Labs support. It opens the Lua window for an hour.</description>
  <password>true</password>
</property>
<!-- #endif -->
```

Its `driver.lua` takes the library next to its other requires:

```lua
--#ifdef DRIVERCENTRAL
local supportCode = require("lib.support-code")
--#endif
```

and the property's handler with its other property handlers:

```lua
--#ifdef DRIVERCENTRAL
--- Not logged: the value is the code.
function OPC.Support_Code(propertyValue)
  supportCode:enter(propertyValue)
end
--#endif
```

The library clears the property at once, keeps its value out of the dispatcher's
Trace output, and prints its answer to the Lua output whatever Log Mode is. A
driver that shows more while the window is open (extra properties or log levels)
passes `supportCode:onChange(function(open) ... end)`.
